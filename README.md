# Smart Waste Management System

###  Overview
It is seen that a number of times the dustbins are getting overflown and concern people don’t get the information within a time and due to which unsanitary conditions formed in the surroundings sometimes leading to spread of harmful diseases, also the bad smell spreads due to accumulation of waste over a long period of time. In order to overcome all these problems, a smart waste management system can be helpful in auto-management of waste without human interaction in order to maintain a clean environment.

### Objective
The smart, sensor-based dustbin will judge the level of waste in it and send the message directly to the concerned garbage collection truck. The Smart Bins can sense all the types of waste material either it is in the form of solid or liquid. According to the filled level of the dustbin, the garbage collection truck will choose the shortest path to reach the location of the Smart Bin in order to collect the garbage with the help of the android app, which will save their time, petrol and will significantly help in minimizing the air pollution. Smart Bin emphasizes on ‘Digital India’, if there is any problem with any component in the future, that component can be easily replaceable with new one without any difficulty and delay. 
The main objectives are as follows: 
 - Monitoring of waste management effectively
 - Providing smart technology for the waste system
 - Minimizing human intervention
 - Reducing human time and effort
 - Resulting in a healthy and waste ridden environment

### Advantages
 - Less time and fuel consumption as the trucks go only to the filled containers
 - Decreased noise, traffic flow and air pollution as a result of less trucks on the roads
 - Our smart operating system enables two-way communication between the dustbin deployed in the city and service operator
 -  The sensors installed in the containers provide real time information on the fill level. This information helps determine when and where to prioritize collection
